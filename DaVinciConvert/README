Use this tool to convert your simplify 3D gcode for use with daVinci Pro. The Pro is sadly not supported at the moment, but I hope it will be in the future.

The most interesting magic is within the template.txt (including the sepcial M Commands).

Hint: For the machine settings use the dummy.frm file delivered with this project to make your convertable gcode. Have fun!
