Use this tool to convert your simplify 3D gcode for use with daVinci Pro. The Pro is sadly not supported at the moment, but I hope it will be in the future.

The most interesting magic is within the template.txt (including the sepcial M Commands).

Quick usage guide:
- in Simplify3d do:
	- load project
	- make your settings
	- go Tools->Firmware Config and laod Dummy.frm config
	- select "Prepare to Print!"
	- Save Toolpaths to Disk

- in my Tool
	- make your settings
	- open the gCode File and convert

Now send the file to the printer using XYZWare.

Happy printing!

Hint: For the machine settings use the dummy.frm file delivered with this project to make your convertable gcode. Have fun!
